# Labs
* Lab 1: A* implementation for set covering algorithm, located in "set-covering" directory
* Lab 2: Use an evolutionary approach to create an agent to compete with an expert agent using the optimal strategy in the nim game
* Lab 3(on lab 9 folder): Use an evolutionary algorithm to maximize the fitness score on a genome with 4 different problems instance (1, 2, 5 and 10) and 1000 Loci with a miniumum number of fitness calls.
* Lab 4(On lab 10 folder): Use a reinforcement learning technique to create an agent capable of play at tic tac toe game. The agent is trained with a random player

# Quixo
Quixo is a game similar to tic-tac-toe, but with a 5x5 board and a different set of rules. 
The goal of Quixo is to be the first player to create a line of five of their own cubes, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Gameplay:
* Players take turns either:
  - Moving one of their cubes to an adjacent empty space, changing its orientation, or
  - Pushing an entire row or column of cubes, with the moved cube becoming the last in the row or column.
* The chosen action must result in a cube with its marked face up.
* The game alternates until a player achieves a line of five of their cubes in a row.
