# Labs
* Lab 1: A* implementation for set covering algorithm, located in "set-covering" directory
* Halloween challenge
* Lab 2: Use an evolutionary approach to create an agent to compete with an expert agent using the optimal strategy in the nim game
* Lab 3(on lab 9 folder): Use an evolutionary algorithm to maximize the fitness score on a genome with 4 different problems instance (1, 2, 5 and 10) and 1000 Loci with a miniumum number of fitness calls.
* Lab 4(On lab 10 folder): Use a reinforcement learning technique to create an agent capable of play at tic tac toe game. The agent is trained with a random player
